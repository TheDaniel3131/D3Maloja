These are some files to get you started if you don't want to create your own rules.
They are concerned with specific artists / genres and are not complete by any means,
but may help you have a clean database from the start if your music taste happens
to be met by them. If you would like to curate your own ruleset, create a pull request
on GitHub. Please do not simply contribute your complete rule file, but a selection
concerned with a specific genre / category / group of music.
