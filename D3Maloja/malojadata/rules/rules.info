This folder can have any number of tsv files to group your rules

The first column defines the type of the rule:
	notanartist	Defines strings that can appear behind "feat" in a song title, but denote additional information about the track instead of another artist.
			Second column is the string
	belongtogether	Defines an artist with an ampersand or other delimiter in their name. Otherwise, the artist string will be interpreted as two different artists (except when there are no spaces).
			This artist will be accepted without further parsing. If you want to replace the spelling, you need a replaceartist entry instead
			Second column is the full name of the artist
	replacetitle	Defines an alternative spelling of a track title that should be replaced.
			Second column is the 'wrong' spelling. Capitalization is ignored.
			Third column the correct spelling
	replaceartist	Defines and alternative spelling of an artist that should be replaced
			Second column is the 'wrong' spelling. Capitalization is ignored.
			Third column the correct spelling. Use ␟ if the spelling should correct to several artists
	countas		Defines an artist that should be counted together with another artist for chart statistics etc.
			This will not change the separation in the database and all effects of this rule will disappear as soon as it is no longer active.
			Second column is the artist
			Third column the replacement artist / grouping label
	addartists	Defines a certain combination of artists and song title that should always have other artists added.
			Second column is artists that need to be already present for this rule to apply
			Third column is the song title
			Fourth column are artists that shoud be added, separated by ␟
	fixartists	Similar as above, but simply specifies that if any of the given artists is present, all (and no others) should be present
			Second column is correct artists
			Third column is the song title
	artistintitle	Defines title strings that imply the presence of another artist.
			Second column is the string
			Third column is the artist or artists

Rules in non-tsv files are ignored. '#' is used for comments. Additional columns are ignored. To have a '#' in a name, use '\num'
Comments are not supported in scrobble lists, but you probably never edit these manually anyway.

An example file could look like this:


notanartist	In Dreams
belongtogether	Darth & Vader
